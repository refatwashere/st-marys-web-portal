# Full Stack Web Application

This project contains a React frontend (in the `client` folder) and a Node.js/Express backend (in the `server` folder).

## Getting Started

### Frontend (React)
1. Open a terminal and run:
   ```cmd
   cd client
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

### Backend (Express)
1. Open a separate terminal and run:
   ```cmd
   cd server
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   The server will run on http://localhost:3000 by default.

## Project Structure
- `client/` - React frontend (Vite)
- `server/` - Node.js/Express backend

## Customization
- Update the frontend in `client/src/`.
- Add backend routes in `server/routes/` and logic in `server/app.js`.
